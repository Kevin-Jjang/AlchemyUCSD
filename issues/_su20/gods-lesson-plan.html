note: "The series was made as a visual translation between the front and the back of found correspondence. On a tour
through Italy in 1958, Grandparents (Papy & Mamy) sent postcards to their grandchildren (Paul, Cécile and Anne). I was
absolutely taken by the graphic effects that the vintage handwriting, stamp and postmark made together, more than by the
old photographs on the front. But by cutting those out, interesting things happened: poetic images appeared."
