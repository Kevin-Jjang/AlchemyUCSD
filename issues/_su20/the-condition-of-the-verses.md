authorBio: "<strong>Maria Teresa Horta</strong> was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1937. At 82 years old, Horta continues to be recognized for her association with two fellow poets, Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Velho da Costa. In 1971, during the fascist Estado Novo regime the three women (known thereafter as “The Three Marias”) wrote a collaborative work entitled <em>Novas Cartas Portuguese</em> (<em>New Portuguese Letters</em>). The book was banned, resulting in a trial that attracted worldwide attention and identified the three writers as feminist icons. In 1974 the regime fell, and the charges were dropped. Nevertheless, the imprint of an oppressive regime endured for Horta – both in her consciousness and in her poetry. Horta has always considered herself, first and foremost, a poet. She has published 21 collections of poetry. She has also worked as a journalist for several Lisbon publications during the 1960s (one of the few women to do so) and interviewed such renowned literary figures as Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, and Christa Wolf. She edited the magazine, <em>Mulheres</em> (<em>Women</em>) and wrote plays and fiction pieces. She is most renowned as a poet and political activist. She lives in Portugal."

I am of the condition of the verses
with eagerness rescued<br>
I have a pact with the angels
I recognize the trace of light
I want the rigor of words<br>
I sing the flame of poetry
in the most bitter extravagance<br>
I write the excess
with the pain of the blaze
in the desire to be the splendor<br>
And if in each poem
I invent flight
with my poetic voice<br>
I choose lava
<!-- break -->
Sou da condição
dos versos
com avidez resgatada<br>
Tenho um trato com os anjos
conheço o traço da luz
quero o rigor das palavras<br>
Canto a chama
da poesia
na desmesura mais amarga<br>
Escrevo o excesso
com a pena do fulgor
no desejo de ser o esplendor<br>
E se em cada poema
invento o voo
com a minha voz poética<br>
eu escolho a lava
