note: "I was inspired to create this painting by spring nature in my village. I painted apple trees through which
sunlight shines, when the sun goes up, at the beginning of the warm season, burgeoning young leaves on the trees. The
ground is covered with fresh green grass. The artwork was created during the spring of quarantine in 2020. I had the
opportunity to constantly go out into the yard and create, draw inspiration from nature. My artworkshop was in nature,
in the plain air."
