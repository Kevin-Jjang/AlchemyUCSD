    Alchemy is committed to publishing quality, contemporary translations of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction creative
    writing. By dedicating our journal to the publication of high quality translations by students and emerging
    translators, we aim to encourage a new generation of translators. We publish creative translations and adaptations,
    including homophonic, homolinguistic, and other poetic forms. It is our belief that translation can teach us new
    things about writing and about language itself. We look forward to publishing work that is fresh, engaging, and
    thought provoking. Alchemy is based in the University of California, San
    Diego’s Literature and Linguistics departments and is edited and published by UCSD students.
