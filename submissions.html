    <strong>ALCHEMY</strong>, a journal of translation published at UCSD,

    and emerging professional translators that engages translation in both traditional and innovative ways.<br><br>

<div class="centerParagraph themeDescription">
    ​Within the isolation brought on by the global pandemic, many of our closest relationships have become epistolary.
    But translation has always been epistolary on some level—there is an exchange, a reaching across borders, languages,
    and systems of thought & meaning. Each step in the process, each return, becomes its own instance of
    correspondence.<br><br>

    For the forthcoming issue of Alchemy, we invite you to share your correspondences. Interpret the theme as closely or
    as loosely as you are inspired to: translate the poetry of your friends and lovers; the letters of incarcerated pen
    pals; the diary entries of your grandparents; the stories you might have written in an alternate timeline; the
    message in a bottle waiting just for you. Transmit the slow pull of knowledge out of a formative text. Let the
    translation of a poem be your response to its call. Let yourself dwell on distance & temporal stagger, glitch in the
    fragmentation of time zones, accept what is offered to you & offer something in return.<br><br>

    Through these exchanges, we recognize our solitude as permeable; we pierce through isolation with intentionally
    invoked intimacies. We struggle against further atomization. We invite each other in.<br><br>
